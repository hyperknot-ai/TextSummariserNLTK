There are many techniques available to generate extractive summarization to keep it simple, I will be using an unsupervised learning approach to find the sentences similarity and rank them. Summarization can be defined as a task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information and overall meaning. One benefit of this will be, you don’t need to train and build a model prior start using it for your project. It’s good to understand Cosine similarity to make the best use of the code you are going to see. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. Its measures cosine of the angle between vectors. The angle will be 0 if sentences are similar.

Russian hackers are attempting to steal coronavirus vaccine research, the American, British and Canadian governments said Thursday, accusing the Kremlin of opening a new front in its spy battles with the West amid the worldwide competition to contain the pandemic. The National Security Agency said that a hacking group implicated in the 2016 break-ins into Democratic Party servers has been trying to steal intelligence on vaccines from universities, companies and other health care organizations. The group, associated with Russian intelligence and known as both APT29 and Cozy Bear, has sought to exploit the chaos created by the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. American intelligence officials said the Russians were aiming to steal research to develop their own vaccine more quickly, not to sabotage other countries efforts. There was likely little immediate damage to global public health, cybersecurity experts said. The Russian espionage nevertheless signals a new kind of competition between Moscow and Washington akin to Cold War spies stealing technological secrets during the space race generations ago. The Russian hackers have targeted British, Canadian and American organizations using malware and sending fraudulent emails to try to trick their employees into turning over passwords and other security credentials, all in an effort to gain access to the vaccine research as well as information about medical supply chains. The accusations against Russia were also the latest example of an increasing willingness in recent months by the United States and its closest intelligence allies to publicly accuse foreign adversaries of breaches and cyberattacks. The American government has previously warned about efforts by China and Iran to steal vaccine research. Attributing such attacks, however, is imprecise, an ambiguity that Moscow takes advantage of in denying responsibility, as it did Thursday. Still, government officials, as well as outside experts, expressed strong confidence that Cozy Bear, controlled by Russia’s elite S.V.R. intelligence agency, was responsible for the attempted intrusions into the virus vaccine research. We condemn these despicable attacks against those doing vital work to combat the coronavirus pandemic, said Paul Chichester, the director of operations for Britain’s National Cyber Security Center. The head of the center, Ciaran Martin, told NBC News that the cyberattacks were first detected in February and that no evidence had emerged that data was stolen.
